# Openlink
Openlink opens links to video sites like instagram or tiktok in mpv instead of the browser.
Normal links will open in browser.

(This works only with links clicked outside of the browser like IM-clients or something)

## Instructions to get openlink working as intended

Download the installation script:

using wget:
`wget -nv https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evantaur/openlink/refs/heads/main/install.sh -O /tmp/install.sh && bash /tmp/install.sh`

using curl:
`curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evantaur/openlink/refs/heads/main/install.sh -o /tmp/install.sh && bash /tmp/install.sh`
